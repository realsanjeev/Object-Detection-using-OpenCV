# Hand LandMarking

The hand detection module in MediaPipe is based on a machine learning-based model called BlazePalm, which can detect the presence of hands in an image or video stream with high accuracy. BlazePalm is a lightweight model that can run in real-time on a variety of devices, including smartphones and embedded devices.

Once the hands are detected, the hand tracking module in MediaPipe can be used to track their movement and pose over time. The hand tracking module uses a deep learning-based model that can estimate the position and orientation of hands in 3D space. It can track the movement of individual fingers and can be used to estimate hand gestures and poses.

MediaPipe provides a set of APIs and tools that make it easy to integrate the hand detection and hand tracking modules into multimedia applications. The framework also provides pre-built examples and demos that showcase the capabilities of the hand detection and tracking modules.
