# Face Detection
The underlying architecture used in MediaPipe's face detection module is based on the BlazeFace model. BlazeFace is a lightweight and efficient deep learning model designed for real-time face detection. It uses a single-shot detection (SSD) framework with a MobileNetV1 backbone, optimized for low computational resource requirements while maintaining high performance.

The BlazeFace model in MediaPipe's face detection module is trained on large-scale face detection datasets, such as the WIDER Face dataset, which consists of images with diverse face variations in terms of scale, pose, and occlusion. The model learns to detect facial features and landmarks, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and accurately localize faces within an image.

The face detection module in MediaPipe can detect multiple faces simultaneously, providing bounding box coordinates and confidence scores for each detected face. It operates in real-time, making it suitable for various applications, including facial recognition, face tracking, emotion analysis, and augmented reality.
