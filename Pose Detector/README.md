# Pose Detection

MediaPipe provides a pre-built module for pose detection, which is capable of estimating the pose of humans in real-time video streams. The pose detection module uses a deep learning-based model to detect and track the position and orientation of various body parts, such as the head, torso, arms, and legs.

The pose detection module in MediaPipe is based on the PoseNet architecture, which is designed to achieve real-time performance while accurately estimating human poses. It can detect multiple people in an image or video stream and provide keypoint coordinates for various body parts.

The keypoints provided by the pose detection module represent the locations of specific body joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. These keypoints can be used to track the movement of individual body parts and analyze the overall pose and posture of a person.

MediaPipe's pose detection module is versatile and can be used in a wide range of applications. It can be utilized in fitness and sports analysis, gesture recognition, animation, augmented reality, and various other human-computer interaction scenarios.

MediaPipe provides APIs and tools that facilitate the integration of the pose detection module into multimedia applications. It also offers sample applications and demonstrations to showcase the capabilities of the pose detection module and guide developers in its implementation.

## For More Information
[PoseNet](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/05/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in.html) is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for human pose estimation tasks. It was introduced by researchers at Google, and it has gained popularity for its real-time performance and accuracy in estimating human poses from images or video streams.
