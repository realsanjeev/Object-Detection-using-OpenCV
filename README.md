## MediaPipe

MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google for building real-time multimedia processing pipelines. It provides a set of pre-built components and tools that can be used to create complex multimedia applications, such as real-time object detection, face detection and tracking, hand tracking, and pose estimation.

MediaPipe uses a modular architecture that allows developers to build custom pipelines by combining pre-built components, such as video and audio processing modules, with custom application logic. The framework provides a high-level API for accessing its components and tools, making it easy for developers to integrate MediaPipe into their applications.

MediaPipe supports a wide range of platforms, including desktop, mobile, and embedded devices. It also provides cross-platform support for a variety of programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java.

The framework has been used in a wide range of applications, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and video analytics. It is well-known for its accuracy and performance in real-time applications, and it has been widely adopted by developers and researchers in the field of computer vision and multimedia processing.

### Use Caases of mediapipe
1. Face detection and tracking: MediaPipe can detect and track human faces in real-time video streams. It uses a combination of feature extraction and machine learning techniques to detect faces and track them across frames.

1. Hand tracking: MediaPipe can track hand movements in real-time video streams. It uses a deep learning-based model to detect and track the position of hands and fingers in 3D space.

1. Pose estimation: MediaPipe can estimate the pose of humans in real-time video streams. It uses a deep learning-based model to detect and track the position and orientation of human body parts, such as the head, torso, arms, and legs.
